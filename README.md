# Sample Data Creation
I wanted to display my code in this [repository](https://github.com/JReese2018/Restore_Projects_Dummy_Data), however I did not want to expose the information of the clients' information. This Repo shows how I did that with [this py file](https://github.com/JReese2018/Sample_Data_Creation/blob/main/sample_data_creation.py). 

To acheive this, I used the Faker library to get fake names, and emails, then I used the Random Library to generate random phone numbers and client IDs.
